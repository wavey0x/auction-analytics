-- Migration 039: Unified migration to standardize views and constraints
-- - Drops obsolete MV and replaces with dynamic vw_takers_summary
-- - Fixes active_auction_rounds to use epoch seconds and token metadata
-- - Fixes vw_auctions to expose epoch timing and enabled token metadata
-- - Adds unique constraint for price_requests (chain_id, block_number, token_address)
-- - Makes auctions.step_decay nullable when necessary
-- Idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
