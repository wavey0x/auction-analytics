-- Migration 034: Add timestamp column to auctions table
-- The indexer expects a 'timestamp' column to store block timestamp when auction was deployed

-- Add timestamp column if it doesn't exist 
ALTER TABLE auctions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS timestamp BIGINT;

-- Populate existing records with discovered_at timestamp converted to Unix timestamp
UPDATE auctions 
SET timestamp = EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM discovered_at)::BIGINT 
WHERE timestamp IS NULL AND discovered_at IS NOT NULL;

-- For records without discovered_at, use a reasonable default (NOW)
UPDATE auctions 
SET timestamp = EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM NOW())::BIGINT 
WHERE timestamp IS NULL;

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_auctions_timestamp ON auctions (timestamp DESC);

-- Add comment to document the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN auctions.timestamp IS 'Unix timestamp when auction was deployed (from block timestamp)';
